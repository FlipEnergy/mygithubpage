As mentioned in the previous post, I replaced my surface with a rock64 that had an LCD display.
Took some googling to figure out how to use it but eventually I wrote a short python script to display nginx worker stats on the LCD. As for the old surface 3, I just threw the latest ubuntu desktop on it and it is now my (almost) always on dashboard for the homelab.
