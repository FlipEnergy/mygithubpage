Pretend You're Xyzzy is a Cards Against Humanity clone that can be played online with people. I've played it before and found that it was actually opensource and someone has docker images for it. Naturally, I'm hosting it now my friends and I to play.

The writing on the page is all part of the source code and I didn't bother changing it.
