# [Owncast](https://github.com/owncast/owncast)

![Owncast](owncast.png)

Found this cool open source project on reddit. Immediately wanted to use it since I wanted to stream movies to watch with other folks remotely.

Luckily, the application had docker images for it so I wrote up a quick helm chart to deploy it into my k8s. I also embeded it on my homepage just because, but the main site is [owncast.pleasenoddos.com](https://owncast.pleasenoddos.com).
