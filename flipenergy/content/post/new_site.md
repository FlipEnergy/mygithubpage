## I must have lost all self-respect. I can't believe I'm turning my website into a blog.

Anyways, this site is only meant as a place for me to document the evolution of my homelab.

You probably already saw the diagram I made on the homepage, which I will be updating as time goes on. I'll post previous versions of the diagram in later posts too.

I started a homelab because I traded my old graphics card for a broken PC. I fixed it up and felt that I needed to do something with it.
At first, I only ran a Pi-hole ad blocker and OpenVPN but then realized I wanted learn more about kubernetes. That is why I've decided to make most of my self-hosted applications run in K8s.

Here is my homelab in all it's glory.
