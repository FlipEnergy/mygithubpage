This is my current homelab setup. All the code I used to set it up is on my github.

Here are some of its neat features:

- Pi-hole DNS nameserver for ad blocking, using upstream dnscrypt-proxy for DNS over TLS. I set all my machines to use this as their primary DNS nameserver.

- Surface 3 running Nginx to foward traffic from the intertubes to my websites and VPN in K8s. Now with 100% more TLS and subdoamins.

- My server runs Kubernetes with MetalLB to assign IP addresses to k8s services. Everything in k8s is deployed using Helmsman + Helm3.

- Telegraf + Grafana to monitor system resources on my two baremetals.

- Concourse for automation pipelines (like building images for this site!)

- Wireguard for VPN into my network while away.

- Bitwarden as my self-hosted password manager.

- Syncthing for distributed folder syncing between different machines with different OS and my phone

- Whoogle for my default search engine.

- Mattermost server for communication with my family.
