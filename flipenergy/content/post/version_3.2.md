The RPi 1 model b seems to chug a bit for Pi-hole when I'm accessing the Pi-hole admin site and looking thru the queries.

Decided to switch it out for my old surface 3 since I had no use for it at the moment. Set up metrics and stuff on it thru my ansible code so now I'll get server metrics on it too. Seemed like a win-win. Now I'll have to think of something to do with the old RPi.

Anyways here's the new main dashboard page:

And slightly tweaked diagram:
