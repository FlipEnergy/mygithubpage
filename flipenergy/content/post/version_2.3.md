My folks and I used to use Hangouts. However, because that's being deprecated, I had to find an alternative. Taking control of my chat data is a bonus.

I tried Rocketchat but for whatever reason so I just didn't like it very much. Ended up doing some more research and found [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/).

Mattermost is great. It's basically a slack clone and has a Jitsi plugin to allow for anonymous video calls. So now I have a place to share links and pictures with my folks securely, and we can set up a video call at anytime.

I also wanted to move away from using Google as my search engine but wanted to keep the great results which lead to me [Whoogle](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search). As the Author puts it, with Whoogle, I could "Get Google search results, but without any ads, javascript, AMP links, cookies, or IP address tracking". Plus, it has dark mode.
